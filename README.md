# GROUP-5-Cplusplus-PROJECT
This is a C plus plus project for question 1 from  part 1 and   question b and c from  part 2


Q.1.It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices are not stable. If your company needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot simply use this yearâ€™s price as the cost of pencils 2 years from now. Because of inflation the cost is likely to be higher than it is today. Write a program to gauge the expected cost of an item in a specified number of years. The program asks for the cost of the item, the number of years from now that the item will be purchased, and the rate of inflation as a percentage, like 5.6 (percent). Your program should then convert the percent to a fraction, like 0.056, and should use a loop to estimate the price adjusted for inflation. The program then outputs the estimated cost of the item after the specified period. The program should also display the cost difference between every year in tabular until the specified period. But allow the user to choose which price of the pencil he/she want to see (either the pencil cost of specific year from now on wards or each year of specified number of years in tabular format.)
